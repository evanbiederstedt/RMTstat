Description: 
    Functions for working with the Tracy-Widom laws and other distributions 
    related to the eigenvalues of large Wishart matrices.
    The tables for computing the Tracy-Widom densities and distribution
    functions were computed by functions were computed by Momar Dieng's MATLAB package "RMLab". This package is part of a collaboration between Iain Johnstone, Zongming Ma, Patrick Perry, and Morteza Shahram.
